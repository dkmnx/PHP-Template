```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Set up your web server to point to the `public/` directory

## Usage

### Defining Routes

Add routes in `routes/web.php`:

```php
<?php

$router->get('/', 'HomeController@index');
$router->get('/about', 'HomeController@about');
```

### Creating Controllers

Create a controller in `app/Controllers/`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controllers;

class HomeController
{
    public function index()
    {
        view('home', ['title' => 'Welcome']);
    }
}
```

### Using Views

View files are located in `resources/views/`. Use the `view()` helper function:

```php
view('home', ['title' => 'Welcome']);
```

This will load `resources/views/home.php` with the provided data.

### Database Queries

**SECURITY:** Always use prepared statements. Never concatenate user input into SQL.

```php
use App\Core\Database;

// ✅ CORRECT - Use prepared statements
$users = Database::query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email', [
    ':email' => $userInput
]);

// Fetch a single record
$user = Database::fetchOne('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id', [
    ':id' => $userId
]);

// Execute without returning data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
Database::execute('INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (:name, :email)', [
    ':name' => 'John Doe',
    ':email' => 'john@example.com'
]);

// ❌ WRONG - Never do this (SQL Injection risk!)
$users = Database::query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$userInput'");
```

### Helper Functions

- `view($path, $data = [])`: Render a view template
- `current_path()`: Get the current request path
- `active($path)`: Check if current path matches

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Composer
- Web server (Apache/Nginx)
